# Hangman Game

### Running The Program
After [Creating a React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) add the project files.
In the project directory, you can run:
#### `npm start`
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### How To Play
After starting the game a random secret word will be chosen.
Your goal is to find the correct word by guessing what letters are in it.
Correct letter guesses will reveal all occurences of that letter within the word.
Incorrect guesses will reduce your remaining moves. You lose when the hangman is fully drawn (10 wrong guesses).
